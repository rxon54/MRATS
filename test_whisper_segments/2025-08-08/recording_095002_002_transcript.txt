 99% in some benchmark, it means you need something else to really capture how great the model is.
 And one thing we've done very differently with this model is really focused on not just
 these numbers, but really on real-world application. It being really useful to you in your daily workflow.
 So, hearing about it is much less exciting than seeing it. So to show you this model in action,
 I'd like to welcome Adi and Brian to the stage.
 Thanks, Greg. I'm Brian, a solutions architect on the startup
 see you.
