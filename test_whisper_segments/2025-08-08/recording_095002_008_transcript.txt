 going and seeing how this model behaves in practice,
 figuring out what people really want
 and putting that back into model training.
 That's something that I think has been like a real focus
 for this model.
 - It's been pretty great.
 So while this is fixing,
 the other thing that we did during testing
 which was really surprising was we were sort of fresh for time.
 And we had it refactor one of our test harnesses
 to run parallel on Docker
 and set it off, came back like 45 minutes later,
 it's just like it just finished
 And we do.
