 So last month, I was on a different livestream and towards the end, I ran into a bug that I covered up.
 And afterwards, I tried to have GPT-5 or I tried to have GPT-03 fix it for me and it couldn't.
 So while we were testing GP5 before this, I had it see if it could fix that bug for me.
 And to taunt the demo gods, I'm going to see if it can do it on stage.
 All right, let's hope for better luck and with 03 this is less about that fix and more about the behavior of the model
