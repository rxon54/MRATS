## Completed Tasks (as of 2025-08-08)

- Designed and implemented a meeting recording tool based on Spotirec architecture.
- Developed robust CLI and YAML config support for all pipeline options.
- Automated segmented recording with ffmpeg and live file stability checks.
- Integrated Whisper.cpp for local transcription of each segment.
- Integrated Ollama for local LLM summarization, with prompt engineering and rolling summary.
- Implemented ProcessingPipeline class for full automation: recording → segmentation → transcription → summarization.
- Added robust error handling, debug logging, and file readiness checks.
- Created and documented all CLI/config options in README.md and code.
- Published the project as MRATS on GitHub, including requirements and documentation.
- Created a .gitignore to exclude test data, segment outputs, logs, and cache files from the repo.
- Resolved git rebase and push conflicts to ensure a clean, professional repository state.
- Verified that only code and documentation are published, not test artifacts.
- Updated README to reflect actual implementation vs planned hierarchy.
- Added implementation status addendum to requirements and technical plan documents.

## Testing Guide

### Objective
Verify end-to-end automated segmentation, transcription (Whisper.cpp), and summarization (if enabled) using system audio only.

### Prerequisites
- ffmpeg installed and accessible in PATH
- PulseAudio (or PipeWire with PulseAudio shim) running
- whisper.cpp built (binary exists at `~/projects/whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli`)
- Whisper model file present at `~/projects/whisper.cpp/models/ggml-base.bin` (adjust if you use a different model)
- (Optional) Ollama running locally if you later enable summarization (`ollama serve`)

### Command
```
python3 meeting_recorder.py --start --enable-automation \
  --whisper-path ~/projects/whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli \
  --whisper-model ~/projects/whisper.cpp/models/ggml-base.bin \
  --segment-duration 30 \
  --output-dir ./test_whisper_segments \
  --system-only
```

### What Each Flag Does
- `--start` Begin recording immediately.
- `--enable-automation` Run the full processing pipeline automatically on each finalized segment.
- `--whisper-path` Path to the whisper.cpp CLI binary.
- `--whisper-model` Path to the model file to load.
- `--segment-duration 30` Create ~30 second audio segment files.
- `--output-dir` Where segments, transcripts, and summaries (if enabled) are written.
- `--system-only` Record only system (desktop) audio (no microphone capture).

### Expected Directory Structure (example)
```
./test_whisper_segments/
  YYYY-MM-DD/
    recording_HHMMSS_000.wav
    recording_HHMMSS_000.json              # segment metadata
    recording_HHMMSS_000_transcript.json   # Whisper structured output
    recording_HHMMSS_000_transcript.txt    # Plain text transcript
    recording_HHMMSS_001.wav
    ...
  recordings.log
  rolling_summary.md   (only if summarization enabled)
```

### Test Steps
1. Run the command above while some system audio is playing (e.g., a video or music) to produce signal.
2. Wait at least one full segment duration (30s) plus a few seconds for processing.
3. Confirm new WAV + JSON + transcript files appear in the date folder.
4. Open one of the `*_transcript.txt` files; confirm the text matches expected speech content.
5. (If enabling mic or combined modes) Re-run with `--combined` and speak; verify mixed content appears.
6. (Optional) Re-run with summarization enabled (add `--ollama-summary-model llama3` or your model) and confirm `rolling_summary.md` updates after each segment.
7. Stop the process with Ctrl+C and verify graceful shutdown (no partial files left behind).

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] At least one segment WAV file was created.
- [ ] Corresponding transcript JSON and TXT files exist.
- [ ] Transcribed text quality is acceptable (no empty output).
- [ ] Log file `recordings.log` contains entries for each processed segment.
- [ ] (If summarization enabled) `rolling_summary.md` appended after each segment.
- [ ] No orphan temporary files or zero-byte outputs.

### Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Possible Cause | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| No audio captured | Wrong PulseAudio monitor source | Use `pactl list short sources` and adjust config/flags |
| Whisper fails | Wrong path/model | Verify binary exec perms and model path |
| Empty transcript | Silence or extremely low volume | Increase source volume or test with known audio |
| Summarization stuck | Ollama not running or model not pulled | Run `ollama run <model>` once to pre-pull |
| Slow processing | Using large model | Try a smaller model (e.g., base or tiny) |

### Next Tests
- Test with `--segment-duration 10` for faster iteration.
- Test microphone-only mode with `--microphone-only`.
- Test combined mode plus summarization for full pipeline.
- Enable debug logging (`--debug`) to inspect pipeline timing.
